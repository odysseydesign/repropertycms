                        <h1 class="text-center mb-4">Terms and Conditions</h1>
                        <p>These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the <strong>realtyinterface.com</strong> website (“Website”), <strong>https://www.realtyinterface.com</strong> mobile application (“Mobile Application”) and any of their related products and services (collectively, “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and Realty Interface (“Realty Interface”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and may not access and use the Services. By accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and Realty Interface, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Services.</p>

                        <h4>Free until you publish your website.</h4>
                        <p>At Realty Interface, you register, sign in and start to build your property website for free, no credit card required.  When you publish your website which allows you to share to the public, you will select your monthly subscription.</p>

                        <h4>Realty Interface Monthly Subscriptions</h4><br>
                        <h4>Payment Terms for Publishing your Property Website</h4>
                        <p>Upon publishing your property website, your subscription will become active and your credit card will be charged for the first month (billing period). Your credit card will be charged on the same day each month that you originally signed up on or the nearest business day.</p>

                        <h4>Subscription Plan Changes - Upgrade/Downgrade your Plan</h4>
                        <ul>
                                <li>1 Property - <strong>$29.00</strong> per month</li>
                                <li>5 Properties - <strong>$53.00</strong> per month</li>
                                <li>30 Properties - <strong>$130.00</strong> per month</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>If you make changes to your subscription plan (upgrade or downgrade) midway through your billing cycle nothing is billed at that time. Then on your next month's billing day the plan changes you made are prorated based on the number of days that remained in the prior billing period.</p>
                        <p>If you downgraded your plan then a credit is calculated that reduces your next bill, or if you upgrade your plan then our system collects the prorated difference based on the numbers of days you were on the higher plan in the last billing cycle and it also bills for the upcoming months charges. Your invoice will include extra line item(s) for these prorations.
                        <br>
                            You can then delete the property websites you no longer require and publish the ones you require.
